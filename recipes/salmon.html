    <h1>Salmon with Beurre Blanc</h1>
    <img src="../images/Salmon.png"/>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This delectible dish is baked salmon with a creamy and buttery sauce featured in the Ghibli film <i>Porco Rosso!</i></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 salmon seasoned as you please</li>
      <li>3 shallots</li>
      <li>2 250g sticks softened salted butter</li>
      <li>250 ml dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F</li>
      <li>Take a pot and fill it about a quarter with water</li>
      <li>Set this on the stove to start boiling</li>
      <li>Chop the shallots as small as you can without mincing</li>
      <li>Take a pan and add the white wine and shallots on medium heat</li>
      <li>This will sit and reduce. You will want the wine to go down to about 2 tablespoons worth. This will be maybe 10 minutes</li>
      <li>While that's going on take your salmon and season. I used a tray, added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, set the salmon on that and then added garlic salt and lemon juice for flavor.</li>
      <li>Cover the salmon and add to the oven for 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Take the butter and slice it into mini patties like you would  get at a family-style restaurant</li>
      <li>When the shallot wine mix has reduced enough, add a glass or non-wimpy bowl to top of the boiling water to create a double boiler. Add the shallot and wine mix to this.</li>
      <li>Add the butter patties one at a time and whisk until it melts before adding the next</li>
      <li>You can add a couple at a time, just keep adding until it's all mixed in</li>
      <li>Keep this warm while the salmon cooks</li>
      <li>After the 15 minutes uncover and cook for another 15. Internal temp should be 145 F</li>
      <li>Pour the sauce on your finished salmon</li>
    </ol>
